# Universal Paperclips in Minecraft
UPMC is a small recreation of [Universal Paperclips](https://www.decisionproblem.com/paperclips/) that im making to put off doing AI logic for [LCMC](https://github.com/RedRain0o0/LethalCompany-1.21) and get in the habit of actually making commits.

I'm using https://github.com/jgmize/paperclips to look at the sourcecode
